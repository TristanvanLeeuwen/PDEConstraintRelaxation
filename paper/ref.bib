abstract = {In this paper, which is part II in a series of two, the investigation of the Galerkin finite element solution to the Helmholtz equation is continued, While part I contained results on the h version with piecewise linear approximation, the present part deals with approximation spaces of order p ≥ 1. As in part I, the results are presented on a one-dimensional model problem with Dirichlet-Robin boundary conditions. In particular, there are proven stability estimates, both with respect to data of higher regularity and data that is bounded in lower norms. The estimates are shown both for the continuous and the discrete spaces under consideration. Further, there is proven a result on the phase difference between the exact and the Galerkin finite element solutions for arbitrary p that had been previously conjectured from numerical experiments. These results and further preparatory statements are then employed to show error estimates for the Galerkin finite element method (FEM). It becomes evident that the error estimate for higher approximation can - with certain assumptions on the data - be written in the same form as the piecewise linear case, namely, as the sum of the error of best approximation plus a pollution term that is of the order of the phase difference. The paper is concluded with a numerical evaluation.},

abstract = {We study an inverse scattering problem for a generic hyperbolic system of equations with an unknown coefficient called the reflectivity. The solution of the system models waves (sound, electromagnetic, or elastic), and the reflectivity models unknown scatterers embedded in a smooth and known medium. The inverse problem is to determine the reflectivity from the time resolved scattering matrix (the data) measured by an array of sensors. We introduce a novel inversion method, based on a reduced order model (ROM) of an operator called a wave propagator, because it maps the wave from one time instant to the next, at an interval corresponding to the discrete time sampling of the data. The wave propagator is unknown in the inverse problem, but the ROM can be computed directly from the data. By construction, the ROM inherits key properties of the wave propagator, which facilitate the estimation of the reflectivity. The ROM was introduced previously and was used for two purposes: (1) to map the scattering matrix to that corresponding to the single scattering (Born) approximation and (2) to image, i.e., obtain a qualitative estimate of the support of the reflectivity. Here we study further the ROM and show that it corresponds to a Galerkin projection of the wave propagator. The Galerkin framework is useful for proving properties of the ROM that are used in the new inversion method which seeks a quantitative estimate of the reflectivity.},

The problem consists of minimizing the distance between a given material data set and the subspace of compatible strain fields and stress fields in equilibrium. We find that the classical solutions are recovered in the case of linear elasticity. We identify conditions for convergence of Data-Driven solutions corresponding to sequences of approximating material data sets. Specialization to constant material data set sequences in turn establishes an appropriate notion of relaxation. We find that relaxation within this Data-Driven framework is fundamentally different from the classical relaxation of energy functions. For instance, we show that in the Data-Driven framework the relaxation of a bistable material leads to material data sets that are not graphs.},

These fields develop formulations that integrate data into physics-based models while exploiting the fact that many mathematical models of natural and engineered systems exhibit an intrinsically low-dimensional solution manifold. In inverse problems, we seek to infer uncertain components of the inputs from observations of the outputs, while in model reduction we seek low-dimensional models that explicitly capture the salient features of the input-output map through approximation in a low-dimensional subspace. In both cases, the result is a predictive model that reflects data-driven learning yet deeply embeds the underlying physics, and thus can be used for design, control and decision-making, often with quantified uncertainties. We highlight recent developments in scalable and efficient algorithms for inverse problems and model reduction governed by large-scale models in the form of partial differential equations. Several illustrative applications to large-scale complex problems across different domains of science and engineering are provided.},

abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed estimates of subsurface medium param- eters, such as soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many right-hand- sides. Application of this technique in 3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While more attractive from the perspective of memory use, the computations costs of iterative methods scale linearly with the number of right-hand- sides. Many sophisticated preconditioned iterative techniques have been de- veloped for the Helmholtz equation, however, they often include model-speci c tuning parameters and are thus not very attractive for inversion since the medium parameters change from one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that addresses both the need to eciently solve the Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost induced by the many right-hand-sides. To solve the Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic pre- conditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is well-suited for inversion because of its robustness. We extend this method to a block-iterative method that can eciently handle multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the computational cost of of the overall optimization procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from stochastic optimization that allow us to work with approximate gradient information. These approximations are obtained by evaluating only a small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the algorithms on synthetic benchmark models.},

@article{Warner2016,
   abstract = {Conventional full-waveform seismic inversion attempts to find a model of the subsurface that is able to predict observed seismic waveforms exactly; it proceeds by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted data directly, iterating in a series of linearized steps from an assumed starting model. If this starting model is too far removed from the true model, then this approach leads to a spurious model in which the predicted data are cycle skipped with respect to the observed data. Adaptive waveform inversion (AWI) provides a new form of full-waveform inversion (FWI) that appears to be immune to the problems otherwise generated by cycle skipping. In this method, least-squares convolutional filters are designed that transform the predicted data into the observed data. The inversion problem is formulated such that the subsurfacemodel is iteratively updated to force these Wiener filters toward zero-lag delta functions. As that is achieved, the predicted data evolve toward the observed data and the assumed model evolves toward the true model. This new method is able to invert synthetic data successfully, beginning from starting models and under conditions for which conventional FWI fails entirely. AWI has a similar computational cost to conventional FWI per iteration, and it appears to converge at a similar rate. The principal advantages of this new method are that it allows waveform inversion to begin from less-accurate starting models, does not require the presence of low frequencies in the field data, and appears to provide a better balance between the influence of refracted and reflected arrivals upon the final-velocity model. The AWI is also able to invert successfully when the assumed source wavelet is severely in error.},

@article{Symes2020,
   abstract = {An extremely simple single-trace transmission example shows how an extended source formulation of full waveform inversion can produce an optimization problem without spurious local minima ("cycle skipping"). The data consist of a single trace recorded at a given distance from a point source. The velocity or slowness is presumed homogeneous, and the target source wavelet is presumed quasi-impulsive or focused at zero time lag. The source is extended by permitting energy to spread in time, and the spread is controlled by adding a weighted mean square of the extended source wavelet to the data misfit, to produce the extended inversion objective. The objective function and its gradient can be computed explicitly in this very simple example, and it is easily seen that all local minimizers must be within a wavelength of the correct slowness - that is, cycle-skipping cannot occur. Calculation of the gradient reveals that the minimization avoids cycle-skipping only if the weight operator is differential, a requirement shared with extended source inversion algorithms applicable at field scale.},
